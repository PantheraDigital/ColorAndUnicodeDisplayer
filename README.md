# ColorAndUnicodeDisplayer
A wrapper class to make it easy to use unicode and color in the console with C++

I created this class for the school projects I had to make that were dominant created using the debug console. Including this class allows for easier color control of output text. 

Files with "MK2" in the name are for a planned update to attempt to make the class work using templates to slim down amount of functions. The type would be the type to be displayed instead of a function to show different types.
